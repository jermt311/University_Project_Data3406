# Ethics 
**Premise of Ethical Data collection** <br />
<br />
Data collection is a necessity in today's world in many different fields of study and application. To learn more about a certain issue experienced by a group or people or even just to further a certain field of study, more data has to be collected.
Data collection takes place in many methods including;  <br />
- Surveys <br />
- Interviews <br />
- Observations <br />
<br />
Through the course of this Assignment, Group 3 will be using google forms to collect our (survey) data where in turn, have the participants email us their step data. We have ensured that the data that we would be collecting from the survey are truly needed so as to ensure we don’t collect data that would not be required. To ensure that participants know the purpose of the study and how their data will be used, we have provided them with a participant consent form which states;<br />
<br />
1) What the Assignment is about <br />
2) Who is carrying out the study <br />
3) What is involved in the study <br />
4) Permission to withdraw from the study (at any time) <br />
5) Data anonymisation, usage, storage and presentation <br />
6) That they understand and accept the terms of participation and that they agree with the data being used for the purpose of the assignment <br />
<br />
Additionally, we provided them the option of requesting the final presentation of the results should they wish for it. By them agreeing to the terms of participation, they have given their informed consent to allow us to use their data for our study. <br />
**Data Anonymization**
<br />
When we have collected the data from the participants, we intend to duplicate the data. One of the data sets to work on and the other for storage purposes. The datasets that the study would be performed on would have the participants anonymised and have their email addresses replaced with an ID number. While the data kept in storage will still contain the participant’s email address should we be required to contact them again. <br />


**The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act)** should we mention anything about this?  <br />
